	<strong>Coordinates:</strong>
	<a href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=47_40_5_N_18_18_36_E_type:landmark">N 47° 40′ 5″ E 18° 18′ 36″</a> (parking space right outside the entrance)
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Entry</strong>
	When entering the area for the first time (only possible from 8:00-19:30) present your ticket code at the gate/entrance to get in. Then you have to check in at the reception of the location by showing your government-issued ID or Passport (legally required in Hungary for overnight stay). Turn right after the gate and follow the road all the way until you get to the campsite (see the map below). At the campsite, please look for our person who does the registration and get your wristband.

	<strong>Timing:</strong>
	Once you registered (received your wristband at the campsite), you can leave and come back any time you want 0-24, however, check-in must happen between 8:00 and 19:30. The location requires this from us, it is not possible to check in outside this timeframe.
<p>
	<strong>By car:</strong>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_motorway_(Hungary)">M1 motorway</a> is recommended from Budapest,
	Bratislava, and Vienna as well. You have to take exit no. 67 towards Tata and turn left on Oroszlányi u. after a Shell fuel station on the left.
	You have to purchase a vignette for M1, the cheapest option is 10 days for vehicles under 3.5t, which costs
	3820 HUF (about 10 €). Motorway vignettes are virtual, they can be bought on-line with credit card payment on
	numerous sites, the <a href="https://ematrica.nemzetiutdij.hu/">official webshop of the National Toll Payment Services PLC</a> is the cheapest,
	all the others put a service charge on top of the price.
</p>
<p>
	A cheaper alternative is route 1, which goes directly through Tata, but the speed limit is
	50 km/h within towns, and 90 km/h elsewhere, in contrast with 130 km/h on the motorway.
	Cars can be parked on-site, including caravans.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>By plane (via Budapest):</strong>
	While there is a train stop called <em>Ferihegy</em> which matches the old name of the airport, the train stop itself is at the old terminal, which no longer receives passenger flights.
	The cheapest option is to take the <a href="https://bkk.hu/en/timetables/#200E">bus 200E</a> to the end of the line, Kőbánya-Kispest, where you can change both to trains and <a href="http://www.bkk.hu/en/timetables/#M3">metro line M3</a>. You can change from M3 to M4 at Kálvin tér or to M2 at Deák Ferenc tér with a single ticket, see further instructions for traveling by train below.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>By train (from/via Budapest):</strong>
	The train takes about 60 minutes from Budapest to Tata, with express trains departing from Budapest Keleti
	(pályaudvar), others from Budapest Déli (pályaudvar) &ndash; international trains arrive in former, the two
	are directly connected by <a href="https://bkk.hu/en/timetables/#M2">metro line M2</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Train tickets cost 1860 HUF
	for normal, 2555 HUF for express trains. The timetable can be seen and tickets can be booked
	<a href="https://jegy.mav.hu/menetrend/viszonylati?i=005510009&amp;e=005501164&amp;d=2023-07-13T06:00:00.000Z">on-line at MÁV-Start</a>, which is 10% cheaper than buying them in person.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>By train (from Vienna/Munich):</strong>
	International guests want to get to Munich or to Vienna, where the Railjet departs every 2 hours, these are equipped
	with power plugs and also Internet in Austria. You need to get off the Railjet in Győr and take the last stint with a 
	train that stops in Tata. Trains run from Győr at least every hour, tickets costs less than 3 €, which you can order
	<a href="https://jegy.mav.hu/menetrend/viszonylati?i=005501289&amp;e=005501164&amp;d=2023-07-13T06:00:00.000Z">on-line at MÁV-Start</a>.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>By train (from Graz):</strong>
	There are two direct trains (IC 311 and 313) from Graz to Tata every day, ticket costs 23 €, which you can order
	<a href="https://jegy.mav.hu/menetrend/viszonylati?i=008103171&amp;e=005501164&amp;d=2023-07-13T06:00:00.000Z">on-line at MÁV-Start</a>.
