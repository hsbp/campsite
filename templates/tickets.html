<h2>Tickets</h2>
<p>Tickets can be registered

<a href="https://ticket.hsbp.org/camppp7e6">in our ticketing system</a>
and are <strong>required to participate</strong> at the event &ndash; even
for speakers and/or organizers. <strong>Registration is free</strong> and
submitting personal information	is not required. Payment is done on your
last day of participation, which is 1/n-th of the total costs of the camp,
where n is the number of participants. See also
<a href="https://www.ctrlc.hu/~stef/rfc-cpp.txt">our RFC about this</a>.

Every piece of information you submit to our ticketing system will be destroyed by
the end of the event.</p>

<p><strong>Important change for 2022:</strong> since we share the campsite
with others, every participant of the camp must register a ticket for themselves,
as the campsite reception will check the ticket ID with a list of IDs from the
ticketing system and each ID can only be used once. (They won't see any data
you entered such as name, e-mail address or notes, just the random ID we
generate and assign to your ticket.)</p>

<p>Although registration requires no personal data to be entered, you can
verify the <a href="https://ticket.hsbp.org/cert">checksum of the certificate</a>
signed by a subset of the organizers using PGP.</p>
